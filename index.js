		The event modules we are loading have a very specific structure to them
		They all have three components (key/value pairs): name, once, and execute

			name -
				this is where we specify the type of event by name that we are registering a function for
				when an event occurs it notifies our bot of the type of event it is by name
				if there is an event of this type registered with our bot (client) then it will call the appropriate function

			once -
				a boolean(true/false) telling the bot whether it can respond to this type of event 

			execute -
				the function that is to be executed upon this event occurring	*/
